# Calibration-Training
Are centipedes the animals with the most legs? Who of Queen Victoria or Karl Marx was born first? Which of Panama or Belize had the greatest population in 2019?

Regardless of my answers to these and 37 other questions, the real question is: How confident am I in my answers (as a percentage)?
Even more significantly: does my level of confidence in answering these 40 random questions line up with how often I get them correct?
i.e. if I answer 100 questions and claim to have 65% confidence in my answers, will I end up getting exactly 65/100 questions correct?

This is the goal! To know **how well** I know things! But it is very hard. Hence, I did a little excersize to see how good I am at it, to hopefully improve in the future

Above is the output of my results.

It seems I'm underconfident, and assign lower probabilities to my correctness, when in reality I should be more confident.
You can try calibration excersizes yourself at https://www.clearerthinking.org/tools-and-mini-courses?pgid=je3dy4tk-8992b09d-f5ca-40f9-9991-c585c2ebc5b2.
I just wrote this code for practice, but the guys over at Clearer Thinking do a much better job at showing you your progress/results.
